POSTGRESQL (postgres)
=====================

Postgres uses a client/server model:

1. A server, which manages database files, accepts connections, and acts upon the database. The database server program is called `postmaster`.

2. The client's (frontend) application. 

The server forks a new server process for each client connection. `postmaster` is always running, while client and server processes come and go.

    database cluster => database => tables => rows & columns

Creating and removing a database
================================

$ createdb dbname
$ dropdb dbname


Dumping and restoring a database
===============================

$ pg_dump -O dbname > outfile    

If you'd like to compress it:

$ pg_dump -O dbname | gzip > filename.gz

$ dropdb dbname
$ createdb -T template0 dbname
$ psql dbname < infile


Using psql
==========

$ psql [dbname]

\q              quit psql
\?              list psql commands

\i [file]       execute commmands found in a file
\o [file]       send all query results to file or |pipe

\d              list all tables in database
\di             list all indices

\cd             change current working directory
\! [command]    execute command in shell or start interactive shell
