DOCKER
======

Docker, a platform for deploying and running applications. Docker provides a way to run an application securely isolated in a container in a way that is platform agnostic. https://docs.docker.com/

DOCKER CONTAINER: like a directory, it holds everything needed for an app to run.

DOCKER IMAGE: read-only template for a docker container.
  – Uses a union file system (UFS) to 'layer' file system branches on top of each other. Every time a change is made to a Docker image, a new layer is created.
  – Docker images are built from a set a steps called instructions (cf. "plays" in Ansible). These instructions can be built either by executing commands manually or automatically through Dockerfiles.

DOCKER REGISTRY: private or public stores for docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry.
