----------DOCKER----------

Docker, a platform for deploying and running applications. Docker provides a way to run an application securely isolated in a container in a way that is platform agnostic. https://docs.docker.com/

BOOT2DOCKER
===========

The Docker Engine uses Linux-specific kernel features, so to run it on OS X we need to use a lightweight virtual machine. To make this process easier, there is a helper application called Boot2Docker that installs the virtual machine and runs the Docker daemon: https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/


DOCKER ELEMENTS
===============

DOCKER CONTAINER: A Linux Container, (sort of) like a directory, it holds everything needed for an app to run.
  * Docker containers are essentially directories that can be packed (e.g. tar-archived), the shared and run on other hosts. The only dependency is having docker installed on the hosts.
  * Docker containers allow:
    * Application portability,
    * Isolating processes,
    * Preventing access beyond the container's own filesystem,
    * All while being more much lightweight than a virtual machine.
  * When everything is self-contained and the risk of system-level changes are eliminated, the container becomes immune to external exposures which could put it out of order (i.e. 'dependency hell').

DOCKER IMAGE: read-only template for a docker container.
  * Uses a union file system (UFS) to 'layer' file system branches on top of each other. Every time a change is made to a Docker image, a new layer is created.
  * Docker images are built from a set a steps called instructions. These instructions can be built either by executing commands manually or automatically through Dockerfiles.
  * As more layers (tools, applications, etc.) are added on top of the base, new images can be formed by committing these changes â€“ like a version control system!

DOCKER REGISTRY: private or public stores for docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry.
  * There are a bunch of free docker images for common services! https://registry.hub.docker.com/


DOCKER PARTS
============

DOCKER DAEMON: used to manage local docker containers.

DOCKER CLI: used to command and communicate with the docker daemon.

DOCKER IMAGE INDEX: a repository (public or private) for docker images.


WORKING WITH DOCKER IMAGES
==========================

There are many freely available images shared across the docker image index and the CLI allows you to search and download them. For example:

sudo docker search [image_name]
sudo docker pull [image_name]

You can list all images on your system:

sudo docker images

As you work with a container and continue to perform actions on it (e.g. download and install software, configure files), to have it keep its state, you need to commit:

sudo docker commit [container ID] [image name]
