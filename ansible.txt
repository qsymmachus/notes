BASIC ANSIBLE
---------

0. Install Ansible on your local machine

brew install ansible


1. Set up host inventory

Your inventory is found in /etc/ansible/hosts

[app]

server1.example.com
server2.example.com

[db]
server3.example.com


2. Write your playbook

Playbooks contain plays --> Plays contain tasks --> Tasks contain modules

A task calls a module and may have parameters. Example modules include:
– Package management: yum, apt
– Remote execution: command, shell
– File handling: copy, template
– DB management: postgresql_db
– Source control: git

Example playbook:

---
- name: install and start apache
  hosts: webservers
  user: root

  tasks:

  - name: install httpd
    yum: name=httpd state=latest

  - name: start httpd
    service: name=httpd state=running


3. Run the playbook

ansible-playbook my_playbook.yml
