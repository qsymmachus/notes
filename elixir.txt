ELIXIR
======

Elixir is a functional, concurrent, dynamically typed programming language that runs on
on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). Elixir builds on top of Erlang and shares the
same abstractions for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications. Some neat
features of Elixir include:

* Compiles to BEAM bytecode.
* Functional: everything is an expression, recursion over looping, higher-order functions.
* Lightweight concurrency using Erlang's mechanisms.
* Lazy and async collections.
* Pattern matching.

`brew install elixir` to get started.

`iex` runs an Elixir REPL.


BASIC TYPES
-----------

`123`     integers

`3.14`    floats

`true`
`false`

`:foo`     Atoms, similar to Ruby symbols. A constant whose name is its value.
           Modules in Elixir are also atoms (`MyApp.Module`), which is interesting.

`"Apple"`  Strings are always double quoted.


OPERATORS
---------

`+ - * /`          Arithmetic operators. Note that `/` always returns a float.
                   For integer division, use `div()`, for modulo, use `rem()`

`|| && !`          Your standard boolean operators.

`and or not`       Also valid boolean operators, but only if first argument is a
                   boolean. For example: `true and 42`

`== != >= > < <=`  Standard comparison operators.

`=== !===`         For strict comparison of integers and floats. For example,
                   `2 == 2.0` is true, whereas `2 === 2.0` is false.

STRINGS
-------

```
name = "John"      String interpolation.

"Hello, #{name}!"  
```

`"Hello" <> name`  String concatenation.


LISTS
-----

Lists are simple collections of values. They may contain multiple types. They may
contain non-unique values (i.e. they are not sets). Elixir implements lists as 
linked-lists â€“ this means it's faster to prepend than append.

`[123, "Hello", :neat]`

````
"new value" ++ list`     You can concatenate with `++`, either prepending or appending.
list ++ "another!"       It's conventional to describe this function as `++/2`, where
                         `2` is its arity. It's typical to talk about arities in Elixir.
```

```
list -- "Hello"          The `--/2` operator subtracts values from a list, but only the
# returns [123, neat]    first occurence!
```

```
hd list                  `hd` and `tl` give you the head and tail of the list.
# 123

tl list
# ["Hello", :neat]
```

TUPLES
------

Tuples are similar to lists but are stored contiguously in memory. This makes 
accessing their length fast but modification is expensive, because it requires
re-writing the entire tuple to memory.

`{321, "Heya", :cool}`


KEYWORD LISTS
-------------

This is the first type of associative collection in Elixir. It's actually just a 
list of tuples, where the firstelement in each tuple is an atom, and the second 
element is its value.

```
keylist = [name: "John", age: 30]

# This is really syntactic sugar for:

keylist = [{:name, "John"}, {:age, 30}]
```


MAPS
----

This is the second type of associative collection in Elixir, and is more commonly used
than keyword lists. Unlike keyword lists they allow keys of any type and are un-ordered.

```
map = %{:name => "John", :age => 30}

map[:name]  # "John"
```

If the values are all keys, you can use this special syntax:

```
map = %{name: "John", age: 30}

map.name  # "John"

%{map | name: "Vanya"}  # %{name: "Vanya", age: 30}
```
