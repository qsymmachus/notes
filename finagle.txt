FINAGLE
=======

An RPC system that allows you to implement APIs for multiple protocols, specially
designed for high performance and concurrency.


Service
-------

A Finagle `Service` handles RPCs, taking requests and return responses.

A service is a function `Req => Future[Rep]`:

`abstract class Service[-Req, +Rep] extends (Req => Future[Rep])`
