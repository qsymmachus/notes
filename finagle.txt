FINAGLE
=======

An RPC system that allows you to implement APIs for multiple protocols, specially
designed for high performance and concurrency.


Futures
-------

For more detail, see: https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/finagle.html#Future

Finagle uses its own implementation of `Future`s to encapsulate concurrent operations like network calls.

A `Future[A]` may have three states:

  1. Empty (pending)
  2. Succeeded (with a result of type `A`)
  3. Failed (with a result of type `Throwable`)

While you can query this state directly, this is rarely done. You have several options for handling futures:

1. Callbacks – a callback can be used to handle results once they're available.

```
val future: Future[Int] = // Get a future somehow

future.onSuccess { res: Int =>
  println("The result is " + res)
} onFailure { error: Throwable =>
  println("Failed with " + error)
}
```

2. Sequential composition – futures can be composed into a composite operation that pass along results as they
become available.

Scala combinator functions like `flatMap` are used to compose futures in this way. `flatMap` sequences two futures, that
is, it takes a future and a asynchronous function and returns another future:

`def Future[A].flatMap[B](f: A => Future[B]): Future[B]`

```
val fetchFiles(path: String): Future[List[File]] = // do time-consuming stuff
val compressFiles(files: List[File]): Future[List[CompressedFiles]] = // do more time-consuming stuff

val result: Future[List[File]] = fetchFiles("/stuff").flatMap(compressFiles)

result.onSuccess { files =>
  println("Finished fetching and compressing files")
}
```

3. Concurrent composition – futures can also be composed concurrently. `collect` takes futures of the same type,
and returns a future of a Sequence of values of that type. The future is complete when _all_ of the underlying futures
have either completed, or when any of them have failed.

```
val future1 = Future.value(2)

val future2 = Future.value(3)

val collected = Future.collect(Seq(future1, future2) // future1 and future2 run concurrently

collected.onSuccess{ collection =>
  println("Here's your collection: " + collection)
}
```


Service
-------

A Finagle Service handles RPCs, taking requests and return responses.

A service is a function `Req => Future[Rep]`:

`abstract class Service[-Req, +Rep] extends (Req => Future[Rep])`

Clients and servers are both defined in terms of Services – a client
consumes a service, a server publishes one.


Client
------

A Finagle client "imports" or consumes a service from the network. A client provides

  1. A function to _use_ a service: send a `Req` and handle the returned `Future[Rep]`.
  2. Configuration of how to send request, e.g. via HTTP to port 80 of api.example.com

```
import org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.http.{DefaultHttpRequest, HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpVersion, HttpMethod}
import com.twitter.finagle.Service
import com.twitter.finagle.builder.ClientBuilder
import com.twitter.finagle.http.Http

// Build the client with config:
val client: Service[HttpRequest, HttpResponse] = ClientBuilder()
  .codec(Http())
  .hosts("api.example.com:80")
  .hostConnectionLimit(1)
  .build()

val req = new DefaultHttpRequest(HttpVersion.HTTP_1_1, HttpMethod.GET, "/")

// Send the request
val future = client(req)

// Handle the response:
f onSuccess { res =>
  println("neat!", res)
} onFailure { exc =>
  println("aw snap!, exc)
}
```


Server
------

A Finagle server "exports" or publishes a service to the network. A server provides

  1. A function to _implement_ a service: receive a `Req` and return a `Future[Rep]`.
  2. Configuration of how to listen for incoming requests, e.g. as HTTP requests on port 80.

```
import com.twitter.finagle.Service
import com.twitter.finagle.http.Http
import com.twitter.util.Future
import org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.http.{DefaultHttpResponse, HttpVersion, HttpResponseStatus, HttpRequest, HttpResponse}
import java.net.{SocketAddress, InetSocketAddress}
import com.twitter.finagle.builder.{Server, ServerBuilder}

// Define the service. 200 for '/foo', 404 otherwise:
val fooService = new Service[HttpRequest, HttpResponse] {
  def apply(req: HttpRequest) = {
    val rep = req.getUri match {
      case "/foo" => new DefaultHttpResponse(HttpVersion.HTTP_1_1, HttpResponseStatus.OK)
      case _ => new new DefaultHttpResponse(HttpVersion.HTTP_1_1, HttpResponseStatus.NOT_FOUND)
    }

    Future.value(r)
  }
}

// Publish our service on a port:
val address: SocketAddress = new InetSocketAddress(80)
val server: Server = ServerBuilder()
  .codec(Http())
  .bindTo(address)
  .name("HttpServer")
  .build(fooService)
```


Builders
--------

You may have noticed a little magic going on in the examples above.

A `ClientBuilder` takes a set of config parameters and returns a `Service` that can send requests.

```
val client: Service[HttpRequest, HttpResponse] = ClientBuilder()
  .codec(Http()) // required
  .hosts("api1.example.com,api2.example.com") // one or many comma-separated, required
  .hostConnectionLimit(1) // required
  .tcpConnectTimeout(1.second)
  .retries(2)
  .build() 
```

A `ServerBuilder` takes a `Service` instance and returns a `Server` that forwards requests to that service.

```
val service = new SomeService()
val filter = new SomeFilter()
val filteredService = filter andThen service

val server = ServerBuilder()
  .bindTo(new InetSocketAddress(port)) // required
  .codec(Http()) // required
  .name("my filtered service") // required
  .build(filteredService)
```
