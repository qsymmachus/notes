CATEGORY THEORY
===============

Largely learned from Welsh & Gurnell, "Scala with Cats". You have a copy in your `articles` repo.

Monoid
------

A monoid `A` has the following properties:

* an operation `combine` with type `(A, A) => A`
* an `empty` element of type `A`
  * also called an 'identity' element, because `a + empty = a`

For example, integer integer is a monoid beecause:

* Integers can be combined in an associative way: 1 + 2 = 2 + 1 = 3
* They have an "empty" element, 0.

By contrast, integer _subtraction_ is _not_ a monoid because it is not associative (you cannot change the order of the operands and get the same result).

Semigroup
---------

A semigroup is a monoid that can be `combine`ed, but has no `empty` element.

Taken together, we can define both a monoid and a semigroup in the following way:

```
trait Semigroup[A] {
  def combine(x: A, y: A): A
}

trait Monoid[A] extends Semigroup[A] {
  def empty: A
}
```

Functor
-------

Informally, a functor is anything with a `map` method. As an abstraction, a functor allows us to chain sequences of operations over a value within some context (like a `List` or `Option`).

Formally, a functor is a type `F[A]` with the following property:

* an operation `map` with the type (A => B) => F[B]

`map` allows us to sequence computations on values while ignoring some complication dictated by the data type:

```
Future(123).map(_ * 2)
Option(123).map(_ * 2)
List(4, 5, 6).map(_ * 2)
```

It turns out that single-argument functions are also functors! Why is that? `map`ing over a function is simply functional composition. Normally we'd do this manually or with `andThen`, but you can use the `Functor` type from `cat`s to `map` two functions together:

```
import cats._
import cats.implicits._

val doubler = (n: Int) => n * 2

val incrementer = (n: Int) => n + 1

(doubler map incrementer)(5)
// 11
```

Monads
------

Informally, a monad is anything with a `flatMap` method. Monads are also functors, but on top of `map`, they also have `flatMap`.

This allows to sequence more complex computations than functors, since the intervening transformations may _themselves_ return another monad.

More formally, a monad has the following behavior:

* `pure`, of type `A => F[A]` (i.e. the constructor)
* `flatMap`, of type `(A => F[B]) => F[B]`

Monads adhere to a set of "monad laws" that allow us to sequence computations freely:

1. Left identity: calling `pure` and transforming the result with `func` is the same as calling ``func`:

```
pure(a).flatMap(func) == func(a)
```

2. Right identity: passing `pure` to `flatMap` is the same as doing nothing:

```
m.flatMap(pure) == m
```

3. Associativity: sequencing `flatMap`s is the same as nesting `flatMap`s:

```
m.flatMap(f).flatMap(g) == m.flatMap(x => f(x).flatMap(g))
```
