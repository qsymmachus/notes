PHILOSOPHY

PLATO

– The Republic
  – Ostensibly a discussion of "justice", but since "it is easier to grasp big things than small", morphs into the discussion of the ideal state.
  – The structure of the ideal state mirror's Plato's theory of mind:
    – Reason: Guardians/Rulers
    – Thumos: Guardians/Auxiliaries (for a detailed discussion of "thumos", see Angela Hobbs, "Plato and the Hero").
    – Appetite: everyone else!
  – Justice consists in keeping these three parts in harmony; that is, subordinated to reason ("the Philosopher King").

AESCHYLUS

– The Oresteia
  – Clytemnestra, wife of Agammenon, murders him on his return for Troy in revenge for his sacrifice of their daughter, Iphigenia.
  – In turn, their son Orestes murders Clytemnestra.
  – Orestes is put on trial, where the furies are the prosecution and Athena the defense. He is declared innocent, and the furies made into peaceful gods.
  – On this point, interesting contrast between the (feminine) revenge demanded by the old gods, and the (masculine) 'due process' offered by the new.
