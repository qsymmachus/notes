PHILOSOPHY
==========

PLATO

– The Republic
  – Ostensibly a discussion of "justice", but since "it is easier to grasp big things than small", morphs into the discussion of the ideal state.
  – The structure of the ideal state mirror's Plato's theory of mind:
    – Reason: Guardians/Rulers
    – Thumos: Guardians/Auxiliaries (for a detailed discussion of "thumos", see Angela Hobbs, "Plato and the Hero").
    – Appetite: everyone else!
  – Justice consists in keeping these three parts in harmony; that is, subordinated to reason ("the Philosopher King").

– Symposium
  – Socrates and his interlocutors are at a drinking party, each giving a praise of love.
  – Socrates argues that love is a longing to create beauty, and thus its essential quality lies in the lover, not the loved.
  – The lover progresses from:
    love of a single body --> love of all bodies --> beautiful customs --> beautiful things --> beauty 'itself' (i.e. the form)


ARISTOTLE

– POETICS
  – Not so much a work of philosophy as an attempt to analyze, categorize, and criticize contemporary drama.
  – Concerned primarily with tragedy, but also includes a brief analysis of Epic Poetry.
    – It is speculated that there was once a chapter on comedy, but it is not extant.A
  – To my mind, the "Poetics" is most interesting as a historical document on the nature and importance of drama in 5th c. Athens.



LITERATURE
==========

AESCHYLUS

– The Oresteia
  – Clytemnestra, wife of Agammenon, murders him on his return for Troy in revenge for his sacrifice of their daughter, Iphigenia.
  – In turn, their son Orestes murders Clytemnestra.
  – Orestes is put on trial, where the furies are the prosecution and Athena the defense. He is declared innocent, and the furies made into peaceful gods.
  – On this point, interesting contrast between the (feminine) revenge demanded by the old gods, and the (masculine) 'due process' offered by the new.


SOPHOCLES

– Antigone
  – The sons of Oedipus, Eteocles and Polyneices, kill each other in battle as Polyneices attempted to claim the throne of Thebes for himself.
  – Creon, the new ruler of Thebes, decress that Eteocles be given a proper burial, but forbids Polyneices the same.
  – Antigone, sister of the two brothers, buries Polyneices anyway despite the protest of her sister, Ismene.
  – Creon sentences Antigone to be sealed alive inside a crypt, against the wishes of his son and Antigone's bridegroom, Haemon.
  – Creon's obstinancy is repaid when Haemon and Antigone kill themselves in the crypt, and then his wife, blaming him for the death of his son.
  – Antigone as a "Sophoclean hero" – a character who meets misfortune through an unwavering adherence to some principle.
    – Is Creon a "Sophoclean hero" as well?
