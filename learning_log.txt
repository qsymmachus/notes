WHAT DID I LEARN AT DEV BOOTCAMP?


-----WEEK 1-----

1/6/14
- Work more patiently. When you rush you not only make more mistakes, it's a disservice to your partner.
- When multiplying strings in ruby, the string must precede the integer:
	"M" * 3 => "MMM"
	3 * "M" => String can't be coerced into Fixnum
	
	
1/7/14
– regex named captures:
	 /^(?<first_consonants>[^aeiouy\d\W_]+)(?<rest_of_word>.*)/ =~ english_word
	 piglatin_word = first_consonants + rest_of_word + "ay"
– pass value:
	copies object value to another variable (identifier), NON-DESTRUCTIVE
- pass reference:
	copies object reference to another variable (identifier), can be DESTRUCTIVE


1/8/14
- Learned about the Benchmark module.
- Learned about the Prime module.
– Using File.new to read outside files within ruby:
	my_dictionary = []
	File.open("dictionary.txt").each_line do |line|
  		my_dictionary << line.rstrip
	end
– How to write an iterative version of binary search; see algorithm-drill-binary-search-challenge.


1/9/14
- How to use pry and pry-nav as a debugging tool. You can put a "pause" in a program by inserting the following line, then test the state at that moment:
	require 'pry'; binding.pry
- A good approach to the convert arabic number to english number problem, see numbers-in-words-challenge
- How to use command+D in sublime for quick search and replace.
- How to use command+shift+L in sublime for a giant cursor.


1/10/14
– Learned about the Matrix module.
- How to break down a complex problem into manageable psuedocode, e.g. the sudoku challenge. It seemed impossible at first but once we had a good algorithm psuedocoded we finished it in 3 hours.


1/11/14
– Learned the difference between primitive, composite, and abstract data structures:
	primitive: provided by the language itself to serve as building blocks.
	composite: composed of primitive datastructures. In Ruby arrays & hashes are composite.
	abstract: defined by the operations that may be performed not how it is implemented.
- Learned how to implement a stack.
- Learned how to implement a queue.
- Learned how to implement a linked list.
- Learned how to write my own "each" methods using yield.


-----WEEK 2-----

1/13/14
- Learned about rspec and got a little practice using it.
– Learned how inheritance works in Ruby; see orange-tree-2-groves-challenge.


1/14/14
- Learned how to use ARGV to provide ruby with user input directly from the command line.
- Learned how to import and export .csv files in Ruby with the CSV class.
- Learned how to write and use my own modules.
- gets.chomp returns a string by default, convert it if you have to!


1/15/14
- Learned about Nokogiri and how to use it to parse/scrape HTML. See scraping-hn-1-building-objects-challenge, scraping-hn-2-building-objects-challenge.
- How to pass hashes as arguments to avoid argument-order dependency. See design-drill-argument-order-dependency-challenge.
– Learned about the Net Module; see http://www.rubyinside.com/nethttp-cheat-sheet-2940.html


1/16/14
- Learned about MVC design (Model/Viewer/Controller), more helpfully visualized as VCM:
	Viewer --> Controller --> Model
	HTML   --> Ruby/Rails --> Database
- Learned about Object#send. Send can take a string/symbol as an argument, and convert that into a method call: 
	String.send("reverse"). 
It can be a useful way to avoid complicated conditional branching if we're interpreting input in an interface, but this also poses obvious security risks:
	Interface.send(ARGV[0])

	
1/17/14
– Learned that gets.chomp won't work if there are already values stored in ARGV. #shift values out of ARGV before trying to use gets.
– Got some experience working with MVC design with the flash cards project.


1/18/14
– Learned about the colorize gem.
– Learned about the "abort" command.
– Reviewed how to use the SQLite gem in ruby. Databases are structured like arrays:
	$db = SQLite3::Database.open "congress_poll_results.db"
	az_reps = $db.execute("SELECT name FROM congress_members WHERE location = 'AZ'")

	
-----WEEK 3-----

1/20/14
– Reviewed SQL query syntax.
– WHERE won't work with aggregate functions:
	WHERE count(*) > 3 		nope.
	HAVING count(*) > 3		yes.
– Learned how to use combined primary keys in SQL to enforce unique combinations of chosen fields in a table.


1/21/14
– Got a lot more practice using the sqlite3 gem, translating table records into ruby objects and vice versa.
– Learned about the different "layers" of data: raw data, relational databases, ruby interfaces on top of relational databases (e.g. sqlite3 gem), and ORM (object-relational mapping, e.g. ActiveRecord.)


1/22/14
– Introduced to ActiveRecord. First started learning about:
	– Rake files
	– Migrations
	– Associations
	– Validations
	– Models


1/23/14
– More practice with ActiveRecord – wrote my own database from scratch!
– Learned a little about the twitter API gem.


1/24/14
– More practice with ActiveRecord and the MVC model – built a To Do List app with persistent state stored in an ActiveRecord database. Got practice writing migrations, models w/associations, and ActiveRecord queries.
– ActiveRecord associations, assuming "derp" associates with "herp":
	– belongs_to			one-to-one, derp has a herp_id
	– has_one				one-to-one, herp has a derp_id
	– has_many				one-to-many, herp has a derp_id
	– has_many through: 	many-to-many, with through indicating the join table.
	– has_one through:		one-to-one, via a third table
	
	– has_and_belongs_to_many 	many-to-many, with automatically generated join table.


1/25/14
– Learned the basics of Sinatra, a library and Domain Specific Language for making simple web apps. It's dependent on the Rack web server interface, which wraps HTTP requests and responses into forms that Ruby (or another abstract language) understands.
– Reviewed the basics of CSS positioning:
	– Static: boxes is stacked and can't accept a coordinate system (top, left, etc.)
	– Relative: box is stacked and CAN accept a coordinate system.
	– Absolute: box is removed from normal flow, won't affect or be affected by others.
	– Fixed: like absolute, but fixed in place and unaffected by scrolling.
	– Inherit: inherits the position of its parent element.
	
	
	
-----WEEK 4-----

1/27/14
– Learned about request/response cycle.
– Got a lot more practice with Sinatra!
	– Sinatra stores user input in hashes.
		– params is local to each route.
		– session (a cookie) is global for all routes.
	– Sinatra can pass these values to ERB files to be rendered as HTML.
	
	
1/28/14
– Learned more about request/response cycle: how Rack translates requests and sends them down to middleware (Like Rails and Sinatra) for processing, which in turn send responses back up in a form that Rack understands and can send out as an HTTP response. See rack_fun and:
	http://chneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2007/02/introducing-rack.html
– HTTP traffic is usually sent through port 80.
– How to get a local repo running on Heroku:
	– TEST THE APP LOCALLY FIRST
	– Add a Procfile; for a Sinatra project it will probably look like this:
		bundle exec shotgun config.ru -p $PORT
	– This will generate a random name for your app:
		$ heroku create  
	  If you want to change it, you can update your heroku remote address with the following:
		$ git remote set-url heroku NEW_URL_HERE
	– Push your master branch to heroku.
	– Get your app up and running:
		$ heroku ps:scale web=1
	– To stop your app from running:
		$ heroku ps:scale web=0
		

1/29/14
– Starting from a Sinatra skeleton I created a URL-shortening app, complete with users!
– Learned how to write a simple authentication method for a users database.
– Learned about the ruby Digest module, which can be used for hash encryption. Useful for hashing passwords:
	Digest::SHA256.hexdigest("password") => as23df452...
– How to use sessions to keep track of a logged-in user.


1/30/14
– More about sessions in Sinatra: a session is a way of storing state between requests on a server. The session hash is stored on the server, and a cookie (rack.session) is stored on the client side. The client cookie stores a key that associates the client with a session on the server.
– HTML forms can only send GET and POST requests. If you want to send another request, like PUT or DELETE, you must include the following tag in your form:
	<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="put">
– Learned about the z-index attribute in CSS. z-index allows you specify the stack order of elements (how they are layered on top of each other). An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.


1/31/14
– Got practice building a Flashcards web app from the ground up.
– Learned how to make my routes more RESTful!
– Learned a good git workflow for working in groups:
	– Create a feature branch of the latest origin/master
	– When you're done, rebase with origin/master:
		$ git fetch
		$ git rebase origin master
	– Resolve merge conflicts in rebase BEFORE continuing!
	– Push your branch, submit pull request	.
	

-----WEEK 5-----

2/3/14
– Introduction to jQuery: manipulating objects in the DOM, event handlers.
– How to manipulate the DOM with both jQuery and vanilla Javascript.
– See jquery.txt


2/4/14
– Types of testing:
	ATOMISTIC
	– Unit: class level, does class x behave as expected?
	– Functional/controller: controller level, do my controllers behave as expected?
	– Integration: higher level, e.g. test controllers in actual browser (expensive testing)
	– Acceptance: highest level, demo the product to match user expectations
	SYSTEM-WIDE
– "Continuous Integration": common in actual practice, server that continuously runs tests and automatically notifies the team if the latest commit produced an error.
– A lot of testing vocabularly dates back to the days of JUnit (Java unit testing):
	– setup: create the dummy classes for testing
	– teardown: clean up the dummy classes
	– assert: true/false test
	– assert_eq: equality test
– The two main ruby domain specific languages for testing are Minitest & Rspec.
– For Rspec syntax, see "The Rspec book", ch. 16–18.


2/5/14
– AJAX: Asynchronous Javascript And XML (a set of techniques rather than a distinct language).
	– Synchronous responses:  Whole page reloads with each request/response.
	– Asynchronous responses: Each request/response reloads only a portion of the same page.
– How to make an asynchronous request in vanilla Javascript:
    // See docs on MDN:
    var myRequest = XMLHttpRequest.new 
– Making an asynchronous request in jQuery: see jquery.txt
– Scope types:
    – Lexical (C, C++, Java)
    – Block-level (Ruby)
    – Functional (Javascript)
– Closure: a means for storing a particular scope for later use. Closures are functions that preserve any variables that were in their scope when stored, even if they were not explicitly placed inside the closure. In Ruby Procs and Lambdas are closures. In Javascript functions can be used like closures (module design pattern).


2/6/14
– Event delegation in jQuery. If you try to apply event handlers to dynamically generated elements, it won't work. This is because event handlers are only applied to elements on the screen when the script first loaded. You can work around this using event delegation, rather than this:

$("#myList li").on('click', function () {
    $(this).css('color', 'red')
});

Write this:

$("#myList").on('click', 'li', function () {
    $(this).css('color', 'red')
});



2/7/14
– Got practice writing unit tests for active record models using rspec.
– To get 'margin: 0 auto' to work with images, change 'display' to 'block'. Images are inline by default.
– How to make elements draggable; see http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/dnd/basics/
– The "data-" attribute in HTML is fully customizable; it could be "data-id" or "data-name", etc. Useful for DOM manipulation!


-----WEEK 6------

2/10/14
– Learned about a d3js, a javascript library for visualizing data using HTML, SVG, and CSS: http://d3js.org/
– More practice using the Twitter API via the ruby twitter gem.
– Learned about dotevn, a way to store global variables in your app, see https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv
– Solution to N + 1 queries in ActiveRecord: use includes. For example, given two joined tables clients and addresses, don't do this:
    
    clients = Client.all
    
    clients.each do |client|
      // Since addresses are lazy loaded, the following line requires a database query:
      puts client.address.postcode 
    end
    "

Do this:

    clients = Client.includes(:address)
    
    clients.each do |client|
      // All associated addresses are "eager loaded" and stored in clients:
      puts client.address.postcode
    end
    

2/11/14
– How to set and use cookies in Sinatra, http://www.gittr.com/index.php/archive/sinatra-cookie-handling-in-0-9-4/.
– When you set a cookie on the server, you need to tell it which domains may access the cookie or Chrome prevents you from reading it with JavaScript. Make sure you set the domain to an empty string (""), e.g. in Sinatra:
    response.set_cookie("color", {:value => params[:favorite_color], :domain => ""})
– "Monkey patching": adding behaviors/variables to classes on the fly.
– Nice prototype vs. class analogy:
    - Class – Plato's forms; an abstract ideal upon which instances are based.
    - Prototype – Aristotle's categories; no abstraction, real instances that share qualities
    

2/12/14
– Learned about the Strategy Design Pattern.
– Learned about server background processing; see tweet-later-challenge.
    – Jobs are queued and worked on in the background so the user does not have to wait for a
      job to finish to be redirected.
    – We used Redis as our queue and Sidekiq as our workers.
– Learned about OAuth, implemented OAuth 1.0 with Twitter.


2/13/14
– Testing mock-ups to avoid actually writing to the DB: "stub" or "double", and "mock"
    - stub/double - invite something to stand in for something else (like a DB model)
      - Stub of 'Band' model Rspec: 
            band_double = double(:band, name: 'Beatles', awesome: true)
    - mock – something associated with the thing you're testing that is changed by the test;
      usually a simplified "mock" of the associated object, we're just testing behavior.
– Learned how to use the simplecov gem to test test coverage %.


2/14/14
– Learned how to use database caching to avoid repeat requests to an API.
– Got practice setting up background jobs using redis and sidekiq.


-----WEEK 7-----

2/16/14
– Basic introduction to rails!
– If you encounter the following error in rails: 
    ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken 
try adding this to your controller:
    skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token
– Learned about resource routing in Rails. Resource routing allows you to quickly declare all of the common routes for a given resource. Instead of declaring separate RESTful routes for your index, show, new, edit, create, update and destroy actions, a resourceful route declares them in a single line of code in routes.rb: 
    resources :photo
– Route helpers are helper methods which automatically create the string for a resource's URL or path:
    – photos_path – /photos
    – new_photo_path – /photos/new
    – edit_photo_path(:id) – /photos/:id/edit
    – photo_path(:id) – photos/:id
– Learned about rails view helpers like link_to and image_tag
– Learned about rails form helpers: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html
– There are two possible parameters in a web application:
    – query string parameters; everything after '?' in the URL
    – POST data


2/17/14
– Learned more formally about REST (Representational state transfer) architecture. REST is a set of ideas about how a well-designed Web application should behave. The core concept of REST is the existence of resources, each of which is referenced with a global URI. Clients and servers ("components") exchange stateful representations of these resources using a standardized interface (e.g. HTTP).
– Rails controller actions for corresponding resourceful routes:
    – index (all resources)
    – show (one resource)
    – new (form for create)
    – create
    – edit (form for update)
    – update
    – destroy
– Using the link_to helper to generate links:
    - link_to(photo.name, photo_path(photo))
    - link_to("Edit", edit_photo_path(photo))
    - link_to("Delete", photo_path(photo), method: :delete)
– #find_or_create_by method; Tag.find_or_create_by_name("vacation") – either finds or or creates a Tag with the matching name field, then returns it.
– Building within associations:
    category = Category.new
    @post = category.post.build(params)
– Learned about nested resources in Rails.


2/18/14
– How do you write controller tests for nested resources? You need to specify the id of the parent resource:
    get :index, category_id: category.id
– Stubbing a controller method:
    controller.stub(:current_user) { return this }
– Really useful helper methods you should put in ApplicationController:
    
    def current_user
      @current_user ||= User.find(session[:id]) if session[:id]
    end
    
    def check_authentication
      redirect_to root_path if current_user.blank?
    end
    
    def login(user)
      session[:id] = user.id
    end


2/19/14
– RSpec: Why use let? What's the difference between let and let! ?
    – let lazy-loads the assigned variable. That is, it is only assigned if it is specifically       
      referred to in an example. So it is preferable for memory reasons. It also assures that           
      each instance of the variable defined by let is totally new.
    – let! eager-loads the assigned variable before running any of the examples. This is                
      preferable if we want to test actual changes to the database (for example, if we are 
      writing controller tests for #create).
– Got a lot more practice writing controller tests in RSpec.
– Learned how to write feature tests in RSpec with help from capybara.


2/20/14
– 'define_method(cat) do; end' is the same as 'def cat; end'
– When writing a class, wrapping methods in this block: 'class << self; end' Will make the enclosed methods class methods
– Metaprogramming! Or writing code that writes other code. You can do stuff like this:

METHODS = { say_hello: "hello", ... }

METHODS.each do |name, message|
  define_method(name) do
    puts message
  end
end

Or even fancier stuff like this:

# Overriding the Object method #method_missing (this is dangerous stuff!)
def method_missing(method)
  if METHODS.keys.include(method)
    helper_to_run_method(method)
  else
    super
  end
end


2/21/14
– Learned how to render partials in rails views and send rendered partials as responses in rails controllers. View syntax:
    <%= render 'todo', todo: todo %>
Controller syntax:
    render partial: todo, locals: { todo: todo }
– Learned how to integrate AJAX requests into rails by adding 'remote: true' to form_for helper and binding handlers to the 'ajax:success' and 'ajax:error' events.

  $('form').on('ajax:success', someCallback);
  $('form').on('ajax:error', differentCallback);


-----WEEK 8-----

2/24/14
– Refresher on double/stubs in Rspec:   
    double(:dog, bark: 'woof')
    some_object.stub(:some_method?) { true }
    Class.any_instance.stub(:some_method?) { false }
– Learned how to write custom rake tasks.
– Learned about database indices: they are a datastructure that stores 1.) the data from one column for all records in a table, 2.) a pointer to the actual record. The index is usually a B-Tree and is sorted, allowing your database to perform a binary search. This allows you to find a given column much faster than performing a linear search through all records. It's a good idea to create an index for:
    – Columns that you search through regularly.
    – Columns with high cardinality (i.e. variation, so it will benefit greatly from sorting)
    – FOREIGN KEYS! This makes finding associations much, much faster.
– How to build a database index in rails. Add this to your migration:
    add_index :table, :column, name: 'name_of_index'
– Learned the difference between '#update_attribute' and '#update_attributes'. As the names suggest, the former updates only one attribute, while the latter updates multiple. NOTE that #update_attribute DOES NOT perform any validations, so it may be preferred if speed is your goal.
    Object.update_attribute(:only_one_field, "Some Value")
    Object.update_attributes(:field1 => "value", :field2 => "value2", :field3 => "value3")
    

2/25/14
– Learned how to use the XMLHttpRequest javascript object.
– Practiced manipulating the DOM with vanilla javascript.
– Learned how to use the module design pattern in javascript; see miniQuery challenge and notes in javascript.txt
– Javascript is functionally scoped. Ruby is block scoped. This means that:

function() {
  if (true) {
    var message = "hi"  // this identifier is "hoisted" to the top of the function
  }
  console.log(message) // this will print "hi"!
}

def function
  if true
    message = "hi"  # this is local to the if block
  end
  
  puts message  # this will NOT print the message
end


2/26/14
– Javascript callback: when you pass a function as an argument rather than an anonymous function. Note that you are not CALLING the function (someFunction()), but just passing the function itself (someFunction). In this sense a callback is kind of like a block in ruby.
– The scope method in rails. Adding this to your ActiveRecord model:
    scope :red, where(color: 'red')
Allows you to do this:
    Shirt.red  # returns all red shirts.
– First time experimenting with the Handlebars.js templating language.

– .html_safe can be used to tell rails that any html embedded in an interpolated variable is safe to render: <%= @info.html_safe %>
– When using the button_tag or submit_tag helpers, including disable_with in your data attributes will automatically disable the button after the form it is tied to is submitted:
  – <%= submit_tag "Create", data: { disable_with: "Creating..."} %>
  
  
WEEK OF 5/18/14
– Strong parameters: this has changed between Rails 3 and 4. 'attr_accessible' is no longer used, parameters are now always 'strong parameters,' that is they must be whitelisted for assignment within the controller itself. This means you'll have to make a conscious choice about which attributes to allow for mass updating and thus prevent accidentally exposing that which shouldn't be exposed. In your controller:
    def project_builder_exercise_params
      params.require(:comment).permit(:title, :body)
    end
– To skip an iteration in an enumerable or loop, use 'next if...'
– Learned how we deploy to staging and production using Capistrano

– Horizontal scaling: to add more nodes to a system, such as adding a new computer to a distributed software application. 
– Vertical scaling:  to add resources to a single node in a system, typically involving the addition of CPUs or memory to a single computer.


WEEK OF 5/25/14
– the 'split' gem makes it easy to perform A/B testing: https://github.com/andrew/split
– Mailgun makes it easy to automatically send emails. The mailgun gem allows you to easily integrate it with Rails' built-in mailer, ActionMailer. You can use the #headers method to add custom headers to emails sent with ActionMailer. Then we can use mailgun routing to handle user responses.
– To copy your public ssh key to a server:
  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@<server-ip-address>
– In your shell, ^R allows you to search through past commands.

– Single table inheritance in rails (models inheriting other models): http://thibaultdenizet.com/tutorial/single-table-inheritance-with-rails-4-part-1/
  – Models that share a single table are distinguished by a "inheritance" column that specifies type:
In the superclass:
  self.inheritance_column = :type
– Different ways to mass/bulk insert data into your rails database: https://www.coffeepowered.net/2009/01/23/mass-inserting-data-in-rails-without-killing-your-performance/

  inserts = ['(bob, bob@example.com)', '(mary, mary@example.com)', ...]
  "INSERT INTO users ('name', 'email') VALUES #{inserts.join(', ')}""


WEEK OF 7/5/14
– You can use db:migrate:redo to rerun the last migration.
– The ActiveRecord methods #find_by and #where won't work if the model is 'dirty', i.e. if it hasn't been saved to the database yet, but merely instantiated. Use the enumerable method #find instead.
– http://nodeschool.io/ is a good resource for learning node.js


WEEK OF 7/12/14
– Started learning node.js, "a runtime environment and a library for running applications written in JavaScript outside the browser (for example, on the server)".
– Node use asynchronous (or "non-blocking") I/O, a form of input/output processing that allows other processing to continue before transmission is complete. This is in contrast to synchronous I/O, which requires all processing to pause until transmission is complete.

    var cookieValue = $.cookie("test"); => 1
    $.removeCookie("test");
– Learned about the WebSocket protocol, a TCP protocol initiated by an HTTP request which allows a persistent connection between client and server, rather than a request-response cycle: http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-now-supports-websockets
– Note that HTTP 2.0 proposals call for a similar 'persistent connection' stream. It's unclear how WebSockets and HTTP 2.0 will be reconciled, as they seem to have similar aims.


WEEK OF 8/10/14
– Restart your brew-installed version of postgres: 
    pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start
    or more simply:
    pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres
– If you want an active record model to be linked to a table with a name other than the model's, use self.tablename = some_other_name
– If you want a rails controller to choose a layout conditionally, you can pass a method to layout: 'layout :method_that_chooses_layout_string'
– Refresher on how to create Sidekiq workers:


    class EmailWorker
      include Sidekiq::Worker
      sidekiq_options queue: "default"

      def perform(recipient)
        # send the email...
      end
    end

    EmailWorker.perform_in(5.seconds, user)

– A counter cache is an integer column that is automatically incremented when, for example, a table gains an association. This is a way to improve performance if we must frequently query this number. For example, if we want to counter cache the number of orders associated with a customer:

    class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :customer, counter_cache: true
    end

    class AddOrderCountToCustomers < ActiveRecord::Migration

    SomeWorker.jobs.size 
  }.by(1)

  Sidekiq::Testing.inline! # execute workers immediately
  # do something that should create a worker that sends an email
  expect(ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.last.to.first).to eq user.email

– How to test around an error in rspec (i.e. you want to test something other than the mere fact that an error was raised):

  expect {
    # something that raises an error
  }.to raise_error do |error|
    expect(something_else).to eq "to have happened"
  end


WEEK OF 10/19/14

    top: 50%;
    transform: translateY(-50%);
  }


WEEK OF 11/2/14
– Learned about 'full text search' in Postgres, a search across all columns in a table. This requires a 'document' (tsvector) of each record to be generated and stored as a column in the table, and an index is then generated for that column for rapid searching. http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/textsearch-intro.html
– In a rails controller, you can quickly check if a request was sent using AJAX with 'request.xhr?'
– /[[:alnum:]]/ - regex for any single alphanumeric character, including accented characters.


WEEK OF 11/9/14
– Cross Origin Request Sharing (CORS) allows resources to to be requested from another domain other than the domain from which the resource originated. By default, web browsers forbid "cross domain" AJAX requests (the 'same-origin policy').

When a CORS-compatible browser makes a cross origin request, it first sends a "pre-flight" request with the following request headers:

  Host: bar.com [domain request is sent to]
  Origin: http://example.com [domain request was sent from]

The server response include headers that define what domains have cross domain access to a resource, and what type of requests they can make:
  
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com [requests allowed from here]
  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept
  Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS

If the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` includes the request's domain, then subsequent request are permitted, within the guidelines defined by the other response headers.

– To get a list of TCP ports that are currently listening:
  
  lsof -i -P | grep -i "listen"
  =============================
  lsof    list open files

– Method stubbing in rspec:

  allow(NeatModule).to receive(:neat_method).and_return { 
    "return this instead of what you usually do!"
  }

– Static vs. Dynamic Typing:

  Static typing: type checking is performed at compile-time; type is associated with variables not values. 
    – Pros: Allows type errors to be caught early; may result in more efficient runtime by omitting type checks at execution.
    – Cons: Requires explicit type declaration of variables, duck typing is difficult to implement.

  Dynamic typing: type checking is performed at run-time; type is associated with values not variables.
    Pros: More flexible insofar as types and functionality can be determined at runtime, duck typing is easy to implement.
    Cons: May result in runtime type errors.

– Imperative vs. Declarative programming paradigms, perhaps the most important contrasting paradigms:

  Imperative: A programming paradigm that describes computations in terms of statements that change program state. In this respect it conceptually mirrors machine code, in which native machine language instructions alter the contents of memory. 
    – Object-oriented programming languages are imperative.
    – e.g. C++, Ruby, Python.

  Declarative: A programming paradigm describes WHAT computation should be performed and not HOW to compute it. It expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. Functions have no side effects – they are idempotent and do not alter state. 
    – Logical and functional programming languages are declarative
    – e.g. SQL, Haskell, Lisp.


WEEK OF 11/23/14
– Core Postgres Docs. Also see 'postgres.txt':
  Part 1 Overview – http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/tutorial.html
  Part 2 SQL – http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql.html
  Part 3 Server – http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/admin.html

– To pipe psql output to a file:

    postgres=# \o ~/output.txt
    postgres=# select * from foo;

– Object-oriented vs. Functional programming:
  
  Object-oriented:
    – Is imperative.
    – Data and operations are tightly coupled.
    – Objects hide their operations from other objects via interfaces.
    – The central model of abstraction is the data itself.
    – The central activity is composing new objects and extending existing objects by adding new methods to them.

  Functional:
    – Is declarative.
    – Data is only loosely coupled to functions.
    – Functions hide their implementation, and the language's abstractions speak to functions and they way they are combined or expressed.
    – The central model of abstraction is the function, not the data structure.
    – The central activity is writing new functions.

– Polymorphism: the provision of a single interface to objects of different types. Polymorphism has three main subtypes:
  
  1. Ad hoc polymorphism: a function that has different implementations depending on a limited range of types. For example, in ruby '+' can be used to add both strings and fixnums.

  2. Parametric polymorphism: a function that is written generically enough that it can handles parameters identically regardless of type. #push is an example of a parametric polymorphism.

  3. Subtype/inclusion polymorphism: this is often simply described as "polymorphism" in object-oriented programming. Subtype polymorphism guarantees that subtypes have the same interface as their supertype.


WEEK OF 11/30/14
– Class vs. Type in OO programming:
    Class: an object's class defines how it is implemented (its state and operations)
    Type: an object's type refers only to its interface – the set of requests to which it responds.
– Referential integrity "requires every value of one attribute (column) of a relation (table) to exist as a value of another attribute in a different (or the same) relation (table)." Most commonly, this means a foreign key should  points to a relation that actually exists. 
  – This is not always easy to enforce at the application level. See this very useful article: http://robots.thoughtbot.com/referential-integrity-with-foreign-keys
  – In rails, `has_many :posts, dependent: :destroy` helps enforce referential integrity by destroying associated posts whenever the parent model is destroyed. But this `after_destroy` callback is only triggered if the parent model is actually instantiated, so it's not perfect.
  – To work around this, you can use a migration to add a foreign key constraint at the database level:  `add_foreign_key :posts, :users`. This will run the following SQL:

    ALTER TABLE `posts`
    ADD CONSTRAINT `posts_user_id_fk`
    FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `users`(id);

  – You can also mimic the behavior of an the `after_destroy` callback at the database level with cascading deletes (Rails 4.2 only): `add_foreign_key :posts, :users, on_delete: :cascade`. This will run the following SQL:

    ALTER TABLE `posts`
    ADD CONSTRAINT `posts_user_id_fk`
    FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `users`(id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE;

– Read more about foreign key constraints: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-FK
– The Unix philosophy in a nutshell: tools should be independently useful, but have clean integration points.

– UML state diagrams, useful for modelling state machines: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram_%28UML%29
– To validate unique combinations of columns (for example, if you want to ensure a user votes only once on a given question). In your 'vote' model:

  validates :user_id, uniqueness: { scope: :question_id }

– A quicker way to write custom validations: `validate :some_custom_method`

  class Invoice < ActiveRecord::Base
    validate :paid_is_not_greater_than_owed

    private

    def paid_is_not_greater_than_owed
      if paid > owed
        errors.add(:paid, "cannot be greater than owed")

WEEK OF 1/18/15
– Check out this Rails helper: time_ago_in_words(Time.now - 3.days) => "3 days"
– Learned how to use redis as a cache store. For example, if a method is expensive, you can cache the result and check the cache in future calls. A redis cache requires 3 things: a key, a value, and an expiration date.

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  def followers_count
    # Check redis for a cache of the return value:
    key = "User#{id}#followers_count"
    value = $redis.get(key)
    # If there is no cache, find the return value and cache it:
    unless value
      value = followers.count
      $redis.set(key, value)
      $redis.expire(key, 60*60*24) # expires in 1 day
    end
    value
  end
end

– RFC index: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-index2.html 
For example, check out RFC 2616, the original spec for HTTP/1.1


WEEK OF 2/1/15
– DRY up your rspec with shared examples. Somewhere in `/spec/support`:

  shared_examples "an object that can be added" do |num|
    let(:object) { klass.new }

    it "can be added" do
      expect(object + num).to eq 2
    end
  end

Then in your spec:

  it_behaves_like "an object that can be added", 5 do
    let(:klass) { MyWidget }
  end

– The 'satisfy' rspec matcher lets you test almost condition:

    expect(sov.reload.status).to satisfy do |status|
      status == "approved" || status == "queued_for_processing"
    end


WEEK OF 2/8/15
– yEd Graph Editor, a useful apps for making diagrams and flowcharts: http://www.yworks.com/en/products/yfiles/yed/
– Cloud computing actually defined – "deploying groups of servers that allow centralized data storage and online access to services." Cloud computing service models, from lowest level to highest:

  Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): the service is access to computers, whether they be servers, virtual machines, storage, etc.
    – Provider: Responsible for the hardware.
    – Client: Responsible for all software.
    – e.g.: Amazon EC2

  Platform as a service (PaaS): the service is access to a computing platform, including key software, such as the operating system and common dependencies.
    – Provider: Responsible for hardware and much of the software layer.
    – Client: Responsible for the application they deploy.
    – e.g. Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure, Heroku.

  Software as a service (SaaS): the service is access to a specific application and its data. Can be thought of as "on demand software".
    – Provider: Responsible for the hardware and all software.
    – Client: Not really responsible for anything – pure consumer.
    – e.g. Wrike, Zoho, Google Docs.



WEEK OF 2/15/15
– If you're using `remote: true` to submit rails forms via an AJAX request, there are a variety of custom events you can use to trigger callbacks around the request: https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/wiki/ajax

For example, say you wanted to append some custom data to the request:

$('form').on('ajax:beforeSend', function(event, xhr, settings) {
  settings.data += "&custom=" + encodeURIComponent("Here's some custom data!");
})


WEEK OF 2/22/15
– Higher order functions: Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.
– Getting started with Flux: http://ryanclark.me/getting-started-with-flux/
– Article on REST WORST practices: http://jacobian.org/writing/rest-worst-practices
– Article on REST BEST practices: http://phalt.co/rest-digested/
 
  – Each resource should have one URI endpoint.
  – The HTTP method sent to that endpoint should reflect the type of interaction with that resource.
  – The status code returned by the response should accurately reflect the outcome of the interaction.
  – When "scoping" requests, you should use URI parameters: /pokemon?type=fire
  – It is stateless: each request happens in complete isolation of another. No state, such as cookies or sessions, should change how a request is processed.

– Contrasting SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) vs. REST:
  
  – SOAP has one URI endpoint and one HTTP method. All method information and data is contained in the request body, usually XML.
  – The advantage of REST is that URI endpoints are associated with specific resources, and the HTTP method describes how we interact with that resource. We can intuit what a request will do, without knowing anything about how it will be implemented. Moreover, the use of standard HTTP status codes also makes it easy to interpret the outcome of the interaction. Nothing is "bespoke".


WEEK OF 3/1/15
– Good article on HTTP caching: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching?hl=en
– Depth vs. Breadth First Search (searching nodes in a tree or graph):

  BREADTH FIRST: Begin at the root and inspect every neighbor node (nodes at the same level). Repeat the process for each level, working down until you reach the bottom. 
    – Advantages: Usually the shortest path to the node. Good for finding nodes you expect to find near the top of the tree.
    – Disadvantages: Keeping track of neighbors can use a lot of memory if the tree is wide. Not good for finding nodes near the bottom of the tree.
    – Algorithm (using a queue to track node neighbors): 
      1. Enqueue the node and inspect it.
      2. Enqueue all the current node's children. Dequeue the current node.
      3. Repeat until you find the required node.

  DEPTH FIRST: Begin at the root and inspect one branch of the tree all the way to the bottom, then backtrack to the closest unexpected branch and repeat until you've inspected all branches.
    – Advantages: Good for finding nodes you expect to find near the bottom of the tree.
    – Disadvantages: Not good for finding nodes near top of the true. Usually won't find the shortest path to a node.
    – Algorithm (using a stack to track the order we need to backtrack):
      1. Start by putting the root node in a stack.
      2. Until the stack is empty:
        3. Pop the node, inspect it. Return if it's the required node.
        4. Push each of the node's children in the stack.

– How does `this` work in javascript?:

  Global context: it's the global object (usually `window`).

  Function context: it depends on where the function is called. 
    – if it's called globally, it's the global object.
    – if it's called within an object, `this` is that object.

  Constructor context: `this` refers to the object that is constructed.

  DOM event handler: when a function is used as an event handler, `this` is the element that fired the event.

– The 'flexbox' CSS property: "The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (and order) to best fill the available space" (http://flexboxin5.com/). Relevant properties:

  – display: flex;
  – flex-direction: row, column;
  – flex-wrap: wrap [children pushed into next row as resized], nowrap [children always stay in row].
  – justify-content: flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around [where to align children within a row, assuming flex-direction: row]
  – align-items: flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch [where to align children within a column, assuming flex-direction: row]
  – align-content: flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, stretch [how to align the space between rows, if there is more than one row]

The real magic starts when we make the children of a flexbox flexible as well:

  – flex-grow: [integer; size of child relative to other flexible children]
  – flex-shrink: [integer, rate child shrinks relative to other flexible children]
  – flex-basis: [min width, can be pixels, ems, etc.]

Plus you get dead simple vertical centering of an element within a flexbox, by giving the flexbox the following properties:

  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;


WEEK OF 4/5/15
– CKVM, a CentOS virtual machine built with Vagrant, "provisioned dev environment". You do all your work here.
  1. CentOS VM – runs the show
  2. Salt – installs and manages all required packages
  3. Supervisor – process monitoring 
  4. Gearman – background jobs
  5. Memcached – key/value store, used primarily for session and method caching
– Workflow notes:
  1. Git/repos – local machine
  2. Supervisor/Salt – VM
  3. Hostfiles – local machine directs CK traffic to VM
– Vagrant commands, within a directory with a vagrant file:
  `$ vagrant up`    Spin it up, this can take a LONG time
  `$ vagrant status`
  `$ vagrant ssh`    Access the VM
– Supervisor commands (inside the VM):
  `$ sudo supervisor status`    Check active processes
  `$ sudo supervisor restart all`    Good quick fix 
– Some funny SQL injection exploits:
    – If your input is naively passed to a WHERE clauses, you can take on an additional select statement using UNION:

      ' UNION SELECT * FROM users--


WEEK OF 4/12/15
– Mockery, a mock library for PHPUnit. Mock objects like this:

    $mockDatabase = Mockery::mock("Database");
    $mockDatabase->shouldReceive("select")
                 ->andReturn("here's some data");

    $mockDatabase->shouldReceive("select")
                 ->with("specify some arguments")
                 ->andReturn("argument-specific data");

WEEK OF 5/3/15
– Let's learn some Clojure! 
  – In a nutshell, Clojure is
    1. A Lisp
    2. A functional language with immutable data structures
    3. Runs on the JVM, dynamically compiled
    4. Designed for concurrency
  – Clojure is a functional programming language insofar as
    – It provides tools to help avoid mutable state
    – Its functions are first-class objects
    – It emphasizes recursion over iteration
  – Great resource, "Getting started with Clojure":

– S-expressions, or "symbolic expressions", are a notation for nested, tree-structured, list data. S-expressions are defined as either:

    1. an atom (which may be a character, string, number, function), or
    2. an expression of the form (x . y), where x and y are s-expressions.

Most modern s-expression notations use a simplified notation that renders this:

(x . (y . (z . NIL)))

Like this:

(x y z)

S-expressions are also easily represented as binary trees:

   .
  / \
 x   .
    / \
   y   .
      / \
     z  nil

S expressions use prefix notation:

(* 2 (+ 3 4)) => 14

   .
  / \
 *   .
    / \
   2   .
      / \
     .  nil 
    / \
   +   .
      / \
     3   .
        / \
       4  nil

WEEK OF 5/31/15
– Parsing documents with Clojure: http://blog.juxt.pro/posts/xpath-in-transducers.html
– Faking a conditional assignment operator in PHP:

    $name = $name ?: 'John Doe';


WEEK OF 6/7/15
– Reactive Programming: "a programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of change." Data flows should be easily expressed in the underlying language, and changes will automatically propagate through the dataflow at execution. For example, if we define 'a' as:

  a = b + c

Any change to 'b' or 'c' will automatically change 'a', in contrast to purely imperative programming.

– Referential transparency: a function or expression is referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its value without changing program behavior. For example, a pure function with no side effects is referentially transparent.


WEEK OF 6/14/15
– The simplest definition of functional programming is programming with pure functions. A pure function

  1. Has no side effects to program state,
  2. Is referentially transparent; that is, it can be substituted for the value it returns, or vice versa, without affecting program behavior.

More formally, 

f(a) = b

Given 'a', f() will always return 'b', regardless of program state. Every value of 'a' has exactly one value of 'b' that is returned by the function.

Using pure functions has two chief advantages:

  1. It allows for a natural mode of reasoning about a program called the "substitution model" – we can imagine program processes like an equation, expanding or abbreviating expressions and functions that are referentially transparent. This is often easier than reasoning about procedural changes to program state.
  2. Pure functions are more modular and composable, since they are defined purely by their inputs and outputs, and have no unexpected side effects.


WEEK OF 6/21/15
– "Currying": converting a function of two arguments into a function of one argument through partial application of the function. 'curry' is in effect a closure that contains one of the two arguments already. Take this polymorphic scala function as an example, which takes a function with two args as its arguments, and returns a function with one arg:

  curry[A, B, C] (f: (A, B) => C): A => (B => C) = 
    a => b => f(a, b)

– Functional data structures: operated on only with pure functions. They are therefore immutable!


WEEK OF 6/28/15
– Non-strictness/laziness: non-strict functions may choose not to evaluate all of its arguments. This separates the _description_ of an expression from its _evaluation_.
