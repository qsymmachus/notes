AKKA STREAMS
============

In big data processing, there are two key problems to grapple with:

1. Blocking
  * Some part of the stream is bottle-necking or "blocking" the thread.
  * This may happen if a process is time-consuming, or if it is trying pull data that is not ready or does not exist.

2. Back Pressure
  * Back pressure occurs in "push" based system when a process produces more data that a consumer can handle.

Akka streams attempt to solve these two problems with Sources and Sinks.


SOURCES
-------

A Source is the input to a stream. Sources have only one output, and no input. Sources might be a database or an RPC call, or any other data source.


SINKS
-----

While a Source is the start of a stream, a Sink is the endpoint. Sinks have only one input, and no output. Like Sources, Sinks might be a database or an RPC call, or any other data store.


FLOWS
-----

Flows lie between Sources and Sinks and are typically used to perform data transformations. A Flow as a single input and a single output.

SOURCES, SINKS, AND FLOWS ARE FUNCTIONS
---------------------------------------

As one would expect of a stream-based system, Sources, Sinks, and Flows are all functions. They are defined only by whether they have an output (Source), an input (Sink), or both (Flow).


RUNNABLE FLOWS
--------------

When you connect a Source and a Sink, you have created a "Runnable Flow". Flows may be intermediaries between the Source and Sink, but you must have both a Source and a Sink to create a Runnable Flow. Sources can't run until they're connected to a Sink.

SOURCE ----> FLOW A ----> FLOW B ----> SINK

Runnable flows create back pressure by communicating between the Sink and Source. When the sink is ready to accept more data, it sends a request BACKWARD through the runnable flow to Source. The Source will then push a set amount of data forward.

This generates back pressure and ensures that the Source does not send more data than the Sink can process.


SOURCE --(data)--> FLOW A --(data)--> FLOW B --(data)--> SINK
       <--(ok!)--         <--(ok!)--         <--(ok!)--

WHAT ABOUT AKKA?
----------------

How does the Akka actor model fit in all this?

An Akka actor does the following:
  * Encapsulates state
  * Encapsulates behavior
  * Receives messages in a "mailbox" and processes them in order
  * Passes its own messages to other actors
  * Runs on its own thread, asynchronously

Akka streams raise the actor model to a higher level of abstraction.
