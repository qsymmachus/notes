GPG CHEATSHEET
==============

Generating a Key
----------------

Advice for key generation changes all the time. If you're generating a new key, read up on 
the latest best practices first.


Managing Keys
-------------

gpg --list-keys

gpg --delete-key <key id>


Exchanging Keys
---------------

# This exports the public key in binary format:
gpg --output my-key.gpg --export <key id> 

# Adding the 'armor' option exports the public key in a human-readable format:
gpg --output my-key.gpg --armor --export <key id>

gpg --import friends-key.gpg


Signing a Key
-------------

# When you recieve a new public key, you should take steps to validate it.
# Take a look the the key's fingerprint and confirm it matches what you expect with
# The key's owner:
gpg --edit-key <key id>

# Once editing the key, check the fingerprint with this command:
> fpr

# To validate it, you sign it:
> sign


Encrypting and Decrypting Files
-------------------------------

# Files are encrypted with the recipient's keypair's public key:
gpg --output encrypted-file.gpg --encrypt --recipient <key id for recipient's public key> file

# Files are decrypted with your own keypair's private key (assuming you are the recipient!):
gpg --output file.gpg --decrypt encrypted-file.gpg
